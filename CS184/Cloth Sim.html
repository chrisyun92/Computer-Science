        <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
        <p>In this project, we implemented the neccesary components to simulate cloth. We first created the points and springs necessary for a grid that acts as the 
        realistic skeleton of our cloth, with physics such as gravity and spring force being applied. After we created this grid, we applied the actual forces 
        of gravity and spring behvaiour. We also implemented Verlet integration to see where the positions of each point would be, and we constrained these new 
        positions using deformation constraints from the 1995 Provot paper. We then simulated collisions with objects such as spheres and planes and made sure to 
        reposition our points on the cloth upon collision. We then implemented self collision and repositioned them there as well. Finally, we implemented shaders 
        such as Blinn-Phong and bump mapping and displacement mapping to finish off our project.</p>

        <h2 align="middle">Part I: Masses and springs</h2>
        <p>
            For part 1, we create a grid of point masses and springs. I first check if the orientation of the cloth is horizontal or vertical, and then I
            create a PointMass with the appropriate coordinates based on the distance between each point in the grid based on width. For every row, we then increase
            the y value and reset the x value to 0. If the orientation is horizontal the y is 1, and if it's vertical then we generate a random
            z coordinate between -.001 and .001 and after the appropriate PointMass is created, we place it in our array. After creating the array of point masses,
            we go back into it and pin the appropriate point masses using the pinned vector to index. We then go through every PointMass and we create structural,
            shearing, and bending constraints (springs and their types) based on whether there are point masses to the immediate left and above, diagonal upper left and diagonal upper right,
            and two to the left and two above respectively.

        <h2 align="middle">Part II: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
        <p>
            For part 2, we want to simulate physics on each PointMass, so we first reset the forces acting on each to 0. Next for each mass we apply the
            formula F = ma on them to simulate gravity. Next we calculate the spring forces acting on each PointMass, so for each spring we check if it is of
            type structural, shearing, or bending and then calculate Hooke's Law Fs = ks * (magnitude(pm_a - pm_b) -rest_length). We then see if we did pm_b - pm_a
            for finding our vector, or vice versa, and if we did pm_b - pm_a then we add Fs to pm_a and subtract it from pm_b and the opposite occurs if we did pm_a - pm_b.
            Then for every PointMass, we find its new positino using Verlet integration, or the formula new position = curr_position + (1 - damping) * (curr_position - old_position)
            + curr_acceleration * timestep * timestep. We set the new position to the result of this equation and set the old position to be the former current position.
            Finally, we do not want the postion of each PointMass to be more than 10% of its rest length in each timestep, so we go through every spring and check
            its point masses' distance. If it exceeds the aforementioned length, we check if both masses are not pinned, if so we then change each to meet halfway such that
            their postions are within acceptable bounds. If either is pinned, we apply the full correction to the non-pinned PointMass.
        </p>

        <p>
            In our simulation, with a very low ks our cloth seems to ripple more and it seems to fold more as it falls into its place. With a high ks it almost
            seems as if there is one fluid wave of motion that dispereses throughout the cloth as it falls. With a low density, the cloth resembles tissue paper as it falls,
            almost like it's being blown by the wind. With a high density, the cloth seems to fall straight like each mass is made of rock. With a low damping, the cloth
            falls at a regular rate and seems to resemble real life, but at a high damping it falls slowly and the forces don't seemed to be applied as much. It is like
            bullet time in the Matrix.

        <h2 align="middle">Part III: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
        <p>
            For spheres, we first check if the (position - origin).norm() <= radius, because if it is then we know our PointMass is inside the sphere.
            If this is true, then we set our tangent point to be the previous vector normalized times the radius, and add it to the origin to get our point
            on the sphere we intersect at. We us the PointMass's last_position and subtract it from the tanget point to find the correction vector. Our position
            for out PointMass is the last_position + (1 - friction) * correction vector. For intersecting a plane, we can tell if it intersects by checking the dot
            product of last_position and the normal times the dot product of the position and normal. If it is less than 0, we know we intersect because this is the only
            way a straight line can pierce the plane mathematically speaking. We then calculate the tangent point to be last_position + (dot(point_defining_plane - position, normal) / dot(position - last_position, normal) - SURFACE_OFFSET) * (position - last_position).
            The rest of the calculations are the same as in sphere intersection. Finally, we go back to our simulate function and call collide on every PointMass
            with every collision object.

        </p>

        <p>
            With a larger and larger ks, our cloth seems to almost shorten in length as it drapes over the sphere. The cloth is less "loose", and it is more
            "tight" at higher ks it seems.

        <h2 align="middle">Part IV: Handling self-collisions</h2>
        <p>
            We first implement our hash_position function, which defines a 3D box of size w * h * t. Where w = 3.0 * width / num_width_points, h =
            3.0 * height / num_height_points, and t = max(w, h). We then take the floor of the position for x, y, and z where each is divided by w, h, or t
            respectively in its float operation. We then multiply the result of each floor by w, h, or t respectively and assign a unique flaot by multiplying
            each coordinate by a prime number and adding them all together. We then implement build_spatial_map, which build a hash table and uses hash_position to
            assign each PointMass to a 3D box if it exists in the table, or creates one otherwise and assigns the PointMass. Every 3D box is a vector of PointMass
            pointers. Next we implement self_collide, which takes in a PointMass. We check if a 3D box for it exists, if so we grab the box and for every PointMass in
            the box we check if they and the given PointMass are less than 2 * thickness apart. If they are, the correction vector is the (candidate_position - position).normalize()
            * (distance(candidate_position - position) - (2 * thickness)). We accumulate the correction vector in a final vector and average it at the very end and
            add it to the given PointMass's position. We then call self_collide in simulate on every PointMass.
        </p>

        <p>
            When our cloth has a low ks, it has more wrinkles and folds more into itself, whereas at a high ks, it seems to fold only a few big times and
            few wrinkles. Similar results occur with a high and low density respectively, with high density having many wrinkles and seeming to fall into itself
            because of the increased density and thus mass to volume ratio and low looking almost like a light wind could tear up the cloth or blow it away.

        <h2 align="middle">Part V: Shaders</h2>
        <p>
            For part 5 for diffuse shading, we simply set the out_color to be the kd * (light_intensity / distance(light_pos, frag_pos)^2) * max(0, dot(normal, normalize(light_pos - frag_pos))).
            For Blinn-Phong shading, we implement the formula ka * u_color + kd * (light_intensity / (distance * distance)) * max(0, dot(normal, normalize(u_light_pos - frag_pos))) + ks * (light_intensity / (distance * distance)) * pow(max(0, dot(normal, h)), p).
            h is the normalize((light_pos - frag_pos) + (cam_pos - frag_pos)). For ka, kd, ks, and p, we define them until we achieve a desirable effect. We set
            the out_color to be the previously calculated result. For the texture mapping, we simply set the out_color to be the sample we get from sampling our texture
            at a set of uv coordinates. For bump mapping, we implement TBN = [t b n], where b is the cross product of the tangent and normal given to us. We also do
            dU = (h(u + 1/w, v) − h(u, v)) ∗ k​h ∗ k​n, and dV = (h(u, v + 1/h) − h(u, v)) ∗ k​h ∗ k​n, since the negation of these 2 are the first two components of the
            local space normals (along with 1 as the last component). Call this normal n0. Note, h(u, v) is a helper function that sampels our texture at the uv coordinates
            and we use the r channel from the returned sample. Our displaced model space normal is then TBN * n0, and we use this in Blinn-Phong
            as the normal and thus bump mapping is complete. For displacement mapping, we changed the actual vertex position so that
            new_pos = old_pos + n ∗ h(u, v) ∗ kh, and we then apply u_model to this to put it in world space. For the gl_position, we do this first transformation
            and also apply u_view_projection to put it into screen space. For mirror shading, we simply calculate the ray to the eye, reflect it, then get a sample from
            the given texture using the resulting vec3 from the reflection.

        </p>

        <p>
            A shader program is a program that takes in data such as vertices and fragments, and transforms them using equations to simulate lighting
            effects as well as other special effect. In simple terms, Blinn-Phong shading works by taking in a position of a fragment and using it as well as
            a normal and uv coordiantes to simulate specular effects. We create an ambient, diffuse, and specular component of light for the fragment using math
            and simulate lighting. When we do bump mapping and displacement on the sphere and cloth, the bump mapping gives an illusion of detail on its surface.
            However, displacement actually changes vertex locations to be consistent with a height map, so the surface itself actually changes. With different "coarseness",
            we can see on our displacement spheres that the higher the resolution, the more spherical the shape.
